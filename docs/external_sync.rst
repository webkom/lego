External Sync
=============

Lego supports contains a system called External Sync. The system executes a background task each
15 minute that export internal users and groups to an external system. We currently support one
instance of each of these systems:

* LDAP
* Google GSuite

GSuite is also a little bit special because this is used as our email management system.
