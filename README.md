Documentation is located at [lego.abakus.no](https://lego.abakus.no). We also have a [beginner's guide for setting up LEGO](https://github.com/webkom/lego/wiki/Noob-Guide).

We use GitHub issues and project boards for simple project management.

## Getting started

LEGO requires `python3.7`, `virtualenv`, `docker` and `docker-compose`. Services like Postgres, Redis,
Elasticsearch, Thumbor and Minio run inside docker.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:webkom/lego.git && cd lego/
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ echo "from .development import *" > lego/settings/local.py
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
$ docker-compose up -d
$ python manage.py initialize_development
$ python manage.py runserver
```

### Testing with elasticsearch

By default, development uses postgres for search. We use elasticsearch in production, so you might want to test things locally with elasticsearch. In order to do so, you need to run elasticsearch from `docker-compose.extra.yml` by running `docker-compose -f docker-compose.extra.yml up -d`. Then you need to run lego with the env variable `SEARCH_BACKEND=elasticsearch`. You might need to run the migrate_search and rebuild_index commands to get elasticsearch up to date.

### Debugging

If you get an error while installing requirements, you might be missing some dependencies on your system.

```bash
$ apt-get install libpq-dev python3-dev
```

> For MACOS you need to `brew install postgresql`

If you get an error while running initialize_development mentioning `elasticsearch`, you probably need run the following code, and then start over from `docker-compose up -d`. [Read why and how to make it permanent on Elasticsearch docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html).

```bash
$ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

If you get ld: library not found for -lssl

```
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
```

When changing the user fixtures one must load new fixtures

```
./manage.py load_fixtures --generate
```

After changes

## Code Style

This codebase uses the PEP 8 code style. We enforce this with isort, black & flake8.
In addition to the standards outlined in PEP 8, we have a few guidelines
(see `setup.cfg` for more info):

Format the code with black & isort

```bash
$ make fixme
```

To check if it is formatted properly, run:

```bash
$ tox -e isort -e flake8 -e black
```

### Tests

If you want to run a specific test class you can run

```bash
$ ./manage.py test lego.apps.[APP] --keepdb
```

By adding the `--keepdb` the next time it will go a lot faster to run the tests multiple times.

If you want to check your test coverage, you can do the following

```bash
# Install the packages needed
$ pip install -r requirments/coverage.txt

# Run a full test run with coverage. This will run all tests in LEGO.
$ coverage run --source=lego ./manage.py test

# Then you can output the full coverage report
$ coverage report
# or a small one that only contains the things you are interested in
$ coverage report | grep [some string]
```

## Deployment

Lego runs in Kubernetes and deploys are managed by Drone and Spinnaker.

How to deploy:

1.  Make sure the changes is pushed to master and the test passes.
2.  Have you added some new settings in `settings/`? If so make sure the Spinnaker deployment reflects these changes.
3.  We run migrations automatically, make sure they work!
4.  Push to the `prod` branch. From master: `git push origin master:prod`

Spinnaker now starts the deployment. This takes some time, tests must pass and we have to build a
docker image.

## Tools

We recommend Pycharm for development, use your @stud.ntnu.no email to register a free professional
